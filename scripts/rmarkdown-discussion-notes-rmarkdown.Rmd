## What are Rmarkdowns?

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html#:~:text=R%20Markdown%20provides%20an%20unified,files%2C%20slideshows%2C%20and%20more.) says

| R Markdown provides an unified authoring framework for data science, combining your code, its results, and your prose commentary. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like PDFs, Word files, slideshows, and more.

Here's the [big book](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)!

## What do they look like?

```{r include=FALSE}
template_rmd <-
  here::here("scripts","analysis-plan-template.Rmd") %>% as.character()
template_html <-
  here::here("scripts","analysis-plan-template.html") %>% as.character()
```

In this folder are examples:

[Here](`r template_rmd`) is an example of the our analysis plan template as an RMarkdown. You can look at as a text file of as an RMarkdown.

[Here](`r template_html`) is an example of the our analysis plan template rendered to html from RMarkdown.

## Good and challenging

**Benefits**

-   Can incorporate code and results from R (and other languages)

-   Renders directly to html

    -   Can also create buttons, folds, etc

-   Renders to other formats

    -   Office: docx, pptx,

    -   iosslides

    -   pdf (with additional apps, which have proven difficult to install)

    -   google docs **but this is not as easy as other formats**

**Challenges**

-   You have to get used to it

    -   Note there are two editors one code forward and the other visual that looks more like word or google docs

-   Different collaboration

    -   Not like the google docs collaboration

    -   MSG methods is using github to collaborate on project documents

## Strategies

-   Should we be using Rmarkdown for everything?

    -   Codeland vs. Googleland

-   What is the role of github?

## What about quarto?

Recently, RStudio unveiled a new Rmarkdown-like file called [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). It is very similar to Rmarkdown, but is designed to work better with more languages and comes equipped with features that are usually add-ons to Rmarkdown.

It is likely that some packages written for RMarkdown are not integrated into Quarto, yet. I haven't tested it much, but wasn't able to use the rstudioapi package within a Quarto file. I imagine that other packages might not have been set up for Quarto yet.

## Below are examples from the Rmarkdown template

### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
